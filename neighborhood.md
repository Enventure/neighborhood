# business model questions

* % donation to enventure non-profit?
* co-op- % of revenue returned thru a dividend?
* other ways for renters to be "invested"?

---

# plan

* ~$10M development
* ~5 acres- develop 1-2 acres at a time
* start as co-living
* expand into co-working, maker space, etc
* develop as little as possible to prove concept
* application process for rent-reduction
